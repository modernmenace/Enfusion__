# Enfusion__

In-Progress (and abadoned) SFML-based Engine I worked on in my (very limited) college free time to be used by my personal projects.

# Features:
 - Fully functional entity-component system
 - Python-based modding support, with a C layer supporting Python->C++ function calls (c++-side Function API incomplete due to unfinished engine)
 - Dynamic sprite layers, supporting a functional clothing/weapon system with support for animations
 - Full inventory system, supporting drag and drop and dropping items into the world to be picked up
 - Dynamic tilemap world generation
 - Animated sprite movement with an overhead camera, following the player without moving over the edge of the map
